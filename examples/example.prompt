Hello! Can you help me understand how neural networks work?

Hello! I'd be happy to explain neural networks. At their core, neural networks are computational models inspired by how biological brains process information. They consist of interconnected nodes called "neurons" organized in layers.

Here's how they work:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives data (like pixel values in an image)
2. **Hidden Layers**: Process the data through weighted connections and activation functions
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final result (like classifying what's in the image)

Each connection has a "weight" that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. During training, these weights are adjusted to minimize errors between predicted and actual outputs.

The key insight is that by combining many simple operations across layers, neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships in data.

How many hidden layers are there in a typical 30B-parameter LLM?
